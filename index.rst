.. F5 orchestration introduction lab using vRO.

F5 Orchestration using vMWare vRO and BlueMedora plugin!
========================================================

This is just a simple introduction to F5 Orchestration using the vRO BlueMedora plugin. In the following workflow We will create a simple Load Balancing configuration in order to get familiar with vRO and the BM plugin.
* Devices are already up and running, licenced, provisionned and attached to vRO

The workflow We will create aims to create:
* nodes, 
* a pool, 
* a Virtual Server 
* and SNAT config

There are much more capabilities provided by the BM plugin but it is not covered in this introduction lab
